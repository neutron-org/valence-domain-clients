# Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files for various blockchain networks supported by the valence-domain-clients library.

## Contents

When populated by the fetch-protos script, this directory will contain:

- `base_networks.json`: Configuration for Base blockchain networks (mainnet and testnet)
- Other configuration files may be added in the future

## Generation

The files in this directory are generated by running:

```bash
nix run .#fetch-protos -- --base
```

or for all configurations:

```bash
nix run .#fetch-protos -- --all
```

## Version Control

The contents of this directory (except this README) are excluded from version control. Each developer or CI system should generate these files as needed.

## Why Needed

These configuration files provide network-specific information required by the clients to properly connect to and interact with different blockchain networks. They include information like RPC endpoints, chain IDs, and block explorer URLs.
