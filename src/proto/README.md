# Protocol Buffer Source Files

This directory contains Protocol Buffer definitions fetched from blockchain projects that are used to generate Rust code.

## Contents

When populated by the fetch-protos script, this directory will contain subdirectories for each supported blockchain:

- `noble/`: Protocol Buffer definitions for the Noble blockchain
- `osmosis/`: Protocol Buffer definitions for the Osmosis blockchain
- `cosmos-sdk/`: Core Protocol Buffer definitions from the Cosmos SDK

## Generation

The files in this directory are generated by running:

```bash
nix run .#fetch-protos -- --all
```

or for specific chains:

```bash
nix run .#fetch-protos -- --noble --osmosis
```

## Version Control

The `.proto` files in this directory are excluded from version control. Each developer or CI system should generate these files as needed.

## Why Needed

These Protocol Buffer definitions are used to generate Rust code for type-safe communication with blockchains. They define the data structures and service interfaces used in blockchain APIs.
