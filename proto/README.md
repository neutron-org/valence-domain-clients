# Protocol Buffer Files

This directory contains Protocol Buffer definitions fetched from various blockchain projects.

## Structure

- `noble/`: Protocol Buffer definitions from the Noble blockchain
- `osmosis/`: Protocol Buffer definitions from the Osmosis blockchain
- `googleapis/`: Google API Protocol Buffer definitions
- `third_party/`: Common third-party Protocol Buffer dependencies
- Various utility scripts for fetching Protocol Buffers

## Generation

These files are generated by running:

```bash
nix run .#fetch-protos -- --all
```

The more modern approach is to use the Nix-based fetching script rather than the shell scripts in this directory.

## Version Control

The contents of this directory (except this README) are excluded from version control. Each developer or CI system should generate these files as needed.

## Relationship to Other Directories

- `src/proto/`: Contains hand-written Rust code and stubs that interface with these Protocol Buffer definitions
- `third_party/`: Contains common dependencies used by Cosmos Protocol Buffers

## Why Needed

These Protocol Buffer definitions define the data models and API interfaces for interacting with various blockchains. They are used to generate Rust code for serializing and deserializing blockchain data.
