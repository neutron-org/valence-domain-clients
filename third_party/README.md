# Third-Party Protocol Buffer Dependencies

This directory contains third-party Protocol Buffer dependencies used by Cosmos-based blockchains and required for proper code generation.

These third-party dependencies are required for proper compilation of Cosmos blockchain protocol buffer definitions. They provide extensions and annotations used in Cosmos SDK and related projects. 

## Contents

When populated by the fetch-protos script, this directory will contain:

- `gogoproto/gogo.proto`: Extensions for Protocol Buffers used by gogo/protobuf
- `cosmos_proto/cosmos.proto`: Cosmos SDK-specific Protocol Buffer extensions
- `amino/amino.proto`: Amino encoding-related Protocol Buffer definitions

## Generation

The files in this directory are generated by running:

```bash
nix run .#fetch-protos -- --all
```

or for specific dependencies:

```bash
nix run .#fetch-protos -- --cosmos-sdk
```

## Version Control

The contents of this directory (except this README) are excluded from version control to avoid conflicts and repository bloat. Each developer or CI system should generate these files as needed.
